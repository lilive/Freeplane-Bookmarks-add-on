# ![bookmark-img](bookmark.png) Bookmarks for Freeplane

[Voir en français](README-fr.md)

You may prefer to use [the beta version](tree/devel) which introduce keyboard shortcuts to chosen bookmarks.

This simple add-on allows to bookmark some nodes in a Freeplane map, and to easily navigate beetween them.

It add a new icon to Freeplane, which is used to bookmark the nodes.


A new "Bookmarks" menu is available, and allows to :

- Toggle a bookmark for the selected node (the bookmark icon is added or removed from the selected node).

- Jump to the previous or the next bookmark.

- Temporaly display only the bookmarked nodes, select one, and go back to the previous map state, with this node selected.

Feel free to contribute or to [notify issues](../../issues).

## Installation

- Download the *bookmarks.addon.mm** file from [the latest stable release](../../releases).
- Open this file with Freeplane and follow the instructions.

### Disclaimer

For now, this add-on has not been heavily tested. I already use it for myself, and I think it's okay, but I prefer to warn: use it at your own risks. Any feedbacks appreciated !
