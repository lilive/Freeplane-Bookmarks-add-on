# ![bookmark-img](bookmark.png) Bookmarks for Freeplane

[Voir en français](README-fr.md)

This simple add-on allows to bookmark some nodes in a Freeplane map, and to easily navigate beetween them.

It add a new icon to Freeplane, which is used to bookmark the nodes.


A new "Bookmarks" menu is available, and allows to :

- Toggle a bookmark for the selected node (the bookmark icon is added or removed from the selected node).

- Jump to the previous or the next bookmark.

- Temporaly display only the bookmarked nodes, select one, and go back to the previous map state, with this node selected.

Feel free to contribute or to [notify issues](../../issues).
